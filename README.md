# COVID
## What is it?
An Android based Application that can prevent the spread of Corona Virus.
## How does it work?
It makes use of the GPS Service and keeps track of the location of the user. It then checks the user's surrounding for possible covid patients and the people who are asked to stay in quarantine and alerts the user about the same.
## Why this app?
We all know Corona Virus is very commutative and spreads very quickly and also the symptoms of this Virus show up very late so we might unintentionally spread this virus even more. To avoid this the whole country is in lockdown. But because of the lockdown, the economy is also getting effected.
But what if we somehow already know about our surroundings? Then we can prevent the spread of the virus and can stay safe and work as well. That's where this app can play its part.
